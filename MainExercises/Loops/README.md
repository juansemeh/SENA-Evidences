These files will help:
1. The .gitignore will prevent unnecessary files from being tracked in version control
2. The README.md provides clear documentation about the directory's contents, how to run the programs, and what features are included

The .gitignore is configured specifically for TypeScript projects and includes common patterns for Node.js development, while the README.md gives a comprehensive overview of the directory's contents and purpose.
