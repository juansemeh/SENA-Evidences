# Objects CLI Applications

This directory contains TypeScript CLI applications demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts and interactive exercises using Node.js.

## Contents

- `class.ts`: Demonstrates advanced class features in TypeScript, including:
  - Class definition with constructor, properties, and methods
  - Private fields for encapsulation
  - Static methods and properties
  - Inheritance and polymorphism
  - Dynamic CLI menu for demo selection
  - Error handling and user input via the `readline` module

- `objects.ts`: Contains interactive CLI exercises:
  - Greeting the user
  - Age check with input validation
  - Subscription confirmation
  - Dynamic CLI menu for exercise selection
  - Error handling and user input via the `readline` module

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed.
2. Install dependencies (if not already):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run class or
   npm run objects
   ```
## Requirements
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- ts-node (optional, for running TypeScript files directly)
- readline module (included in Node.js)

## Notes
- All user interaction is via the terminal/command line.
- Error handling is included for robust CLI experience.
- These scripts are educational and demonstrate both OOP and CLI input handling in TypeScript.
