# Functions Project

This project contains a collection of TypeScript scripts for practicing programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling. Each script demonstrates different logic exercises and interactive menus.

## Structure

- `Functions1.ts` — Basic math and string functions with a menu.
- `Functions2.ts` — (Add a description if you have this file.)
- `Functions3.ts` — Ternary and decision-making exercises with interactive menus.

   npm install
   ```
2. Run any script using the npm scripts defined in package.json . For example:
