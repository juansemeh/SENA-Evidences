# SENA Exercises Repository

**Author:** Juan Sebastián Uribe Lesmes  
**Ficha:** 3144622

## Overview

This is my first GitHub repository. Here I have added the JavaScript and TypeScript exercises assigned by instructor Arle Morales as part of the SENA learning curriculum.

- The exercises are organized by branches:
  - The `JavaScript` branch contains all exercises implemented in JavaScript.
  - The `TypeScript` branch contains all exercises implemented in TypeScript.

## Repository Structure

- `MainExercises/InitialExercises/` – Initial TypeScript exercises (e.g., Blackjack, Traffic Light).
- `MainExercises/Conditionals/` – TypeScript exercises focused on conditional statements and ternary operators.
- `MainExercises/Loops/` – TypeScript exercises focusing on loops and related programming concepts.
- `MainExercises/Functions/` – TypeScript scripts for practicing functions, loops, and user input handling.

Each subdirectory contains its own `README.md` with more details about the exercises and how to run them.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juansemeh/SENA-Evidences.git
   ```
2. Switch to the desired branch ( JavaScript or TypeScript ) to access the relevant exercises.
3. Follow the instructions in each subdirectory's README.md to run the exercises.
